## Iframes

An **iframe** (short for **inline frame**) is a special feature in web pages that allows you to display content from another website or source inside your own page—kind of like a **window inside a window**.  

Think of an iframe like a **picture frame**, but instead of holding a photo, it holds another web page, a video, a map, or even interactive content.  

### Why Are Iframes Useful?

Iframes allow you to:  
- **Embed Videos** – Display a YouTube or Vimeo video inside your webpage.
- **Show Maps** – Add a Google Map without needing to send visitors to another website.
- **Include External Content** – Display content from another site (like a form or a document) without making users leave your page.


### How an Iframe Works

If you wanted to show a YouTube video on your website, you could use an **iframe** to display it **without making visitors leave your site**.  

For example:  

**Instead of saying:**  
*"Go to YouTube to watch this video!"*  

**You can display it directly on your page** using an HTML `iframe` tag, for example  

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" 
  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

This creates a **video box** right on your site where visitors can watch the content immediately.

<iframe width="560" height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" 
  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>


### An alternate approach

In addition to using the raw `iframe` HTML tag as shown above, this Jekyll template also supports the use of a custom Markdown tag

#### Iframe Markdown Code

```markdown
`iframe https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ width=560`
```

#### Rendered Content

`iframe https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ width=560`

### What You Need to Know (Without the Jargon)
- An **iframe is like a small browser window inside your webpage**.  
- It lets you display **content from another website** without your visitors needing to leave.  
- Common uses: **Videos, maps, forms, and interactive tools**.  
- You don’t need to code a full webpage—just copy and paste an **iframe code** from YouTube, Google Maps, or another source.
