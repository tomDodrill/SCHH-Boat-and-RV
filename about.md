This repository is a **GitHub template** designed to help you quickly set up a **Jekyll-powered blog**. Jekyll is a static site generator that takes simple Markdown files and converts them into a fully functional website—no database or complex backend required.  

## Why Jekyll?  
Jekyll is a great choice for bloggers, developers, and content creators who want a **fast, lightweight, and easy-to-maintain website**. Instead of relying on dynamic servers, Jekyll **pre-builds your site** into static HTML files, making it secure, efficient, and easy to host.  

### Key benefits of Jekyll:  
- **Markdown-based** – Write your posts in Markdown and let Jekyll handle the formatting.  
- **Flexible themes** – Customize your layout using Liquid templates and CSS.  
- **Built-in support for tags and categories** – Organize your content efficiently.  
- **No database required** – Everything is file-based, keeping your site simple and fast.  

## Embedded Components for Rich Content  
This template is configured to use an **IFrame-based components library**, making it easy to embed **images, maps, videos, and other interactive elements** using a simple Markdown-based syntax. The library is a streamlined version of the **Juncture web components** and allows for enhanced content creation without requiring complex coding.  

The components library can be found at **[ifc.juncture-digital.org](https://ifc.juncture-digital.org)**, where you can explore available components and see examples of how to use them in your posts. This makes it simple to add rich media and interactive elements while keeping your site lightweight and easy to maintain.

Refer to the sample posts listed below for an example of how these IFrame Components are used in a post.

## GitHub Pages Integration  
This template is optimized for **GitHub Pages**, which provides free hosting for static sites. By pushing your repository to GitHub, your site can be automatically deployed with no extra configuration needed.  

### With GitHub Pages, you get:  
- **Free and reliable hosting** directly from your GitHub repository.  
- **Automatic updates** every time you push new content.  
- **Version control** using Git, making it easy to track changes and collaborate.
